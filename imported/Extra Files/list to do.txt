Im planing to draw some little isometric designs to build out in blender, but is this the right way?
i need to make the buildings in blender then apply the pixelated filter over them and make them so I can use them in godot with my isometric 2d pixel characters I have, so ill also need to be able to rotate the buildings in game so the players have more creative control

 YES, That's a Great Approach!
Your plan is solid for creating high-quality isometric pixel art buildings that work with your 2D characters. Here's how to optimize it:

🎨 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
1️⃣ Blender → Pixel Art Pipeline
Model in Blender (clean, simple geometry)
Render at high resolution (4x your target size)
Apply pixelation filter in post (Photoshop/GIMP)
Scale down to final pixel art size
This gives you clean pixel art with proper perspective
2️⃣ Rotation System for Godot
For 4-directional rotation (most common for isometric):

Option A: Pre-rendered Rotations

Render each building at 4 angles (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
Store as separate sprites
Switch sprites when player rotates
✅ Perfect pixel alignment
✅ Best performance
Option B: Real-time Rotation

Single sprite, rotate in Godot
⚠️ May blur pixels unless using specific settings
3️⃣ Godot Setup
🎮 Recommended: Pre-rendered 4-Direction System
Best balance of quality + creative control - players get rotation freedom while maintaining perfect pixel art quality!

Want me to detail the Blender rendering setup? 🎯


theres an eevee pixel art addon to use for that or atleast its a video on how to do it, is there an isometric sprite sheet addon to use or can we make a py script Id prefer an addon since they work, Im using the most up-dated blender version.


🎯 BLENDER ADDONS FOR ISOMETRIC SPRITE SHEETS
🔍 Existing Addons to Check:
1. Spritesheet Renderers:

"Batch Render" addon (built into Blender)
"Camera Rig for Sprites"
"Isometric Camera Rig" addons on GitHub
"Sprite Sheet Baker" addon
2. Search Terms for Blender Market/GitHub:

"Isometric sprite renderer"
"Sprite sheet generator"
"Batch camera render"
"Pixel art renderer"
🐍 Custom Python Script Option
If no perfect addon exists, I can create a custom script that:

Features it could have:

✅ 4-direction auto-rotation
✅ Batch render multiple buildings
✅ Pixel art render settings
✅ Auto file naming
✅ Spritesheet compilation
🎨 Eevee Pixel Art Setup
The Eevee pixel art technique you mentioned works great with:

Nearest neighbor filtering
Orthographic cameras
Specific material settings
Want me to:

Research current Blender addons for this?
Create a custom Python script?
Detail the Eevee pixel art + isometric camera setup?

## ISOMETRIC CAMERA SETUP & RENDERING WORKFLOW

### STEP 1: Install Pixel Art Addon
- Download from: https://lucasroedel.gumroad.com/l/pixel_art
- Install in Blender: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install
- Enable the addon after installation

### STEP 2: Create Isometric Camera Rig
**Base Camera Settings:**
- Type: Orthographic (not Perspective)
- Orthographic Scale: Adjust based on building size (start with 5-10)
- Rotation:
  - X: 60° (for standard isometric) or 54.736° (for true isometric)
  - Y: 0°
  - Z: 45° (base angle)

**Camera Positioning:**
- Position camera far enough from buildings to fit in frame
- Center building at world origin (0, 0, 0) for easy rotation
- Adjust orthographic scale to frame building properly

### STEP 3: Setup 4-Direction Rotation Cameras
Create 4 cameras for rotation angles (or rotate one camera 4 times):

**Camera 1 - Front Right:** Z = 45°
**Camera 2 - Back Right:** Z = 135°
**Camera 3 - Back Left:** Z = 225°
**Camera 4 - Front Left:** Z = 315°

Keep X and Y rotation constant for all cameras.

### STEP 4: Configure Pixel Art Render Settings
**Output Properties:**
- Resolution: 512x512 (4x your final pixel size)
- File Format: PNG
- Color: RGBA (enable transparency)

**Render Engine (Eevee):**
- Enable: Ambient Occlusion
- Enable: Screen Space Reflections (if needed)
- Disable: Motion Blur
- Disable: Bloom (unless desired effect)

**Pixel Art Addon Settings:**
- Pixel size: 4 (renders at 4x then downscales)
- Use nearest neighbor filtering
- Enable texture filtering overrides

**World Settings:**
- Set transparent background: Film > Transparent

### STEP 5: Batch Render All Angles
**Option A - Manual:**
1. Select Camera 1, render, save as "building_name_0.png"
2. Select Camera 2, render, save as "building_name_90.png"
3. Select Camera 3, render, save as "building_name_180.png"
4. Select Camera 4, render, save as "building_name_270.png"

**Option B - Python Script:**
```python
import bpy

building_name = "cottage"
angles = [45, 135, 225, 315]
cameras = ["Camera_45", "Camera_135", "Camera_225", "Camera_315"]

for i, cam_name in enumerate(cameras):
    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.data.objects[cam_name]
    bpy.context.scene.render.filepath = f"//renders/{building_name}_{i*90}.png"
    bpy.ops.render.render(write_still=True)
```

### STEP 6: Post-Process Renders
**Downscale to Final Size:**
- Use image editor with nearest neighbor scaling
- 512x512 → 128x128 or 256x256
- Keep aspect ratio 1:1
- Maintain transparency

**Verify in Godot:**
- Import PNG files
- Texture settings: Filter = Nearest, Repeat = Disabled
- Test rotation switching in game

### BUILDING LIST TO RENDER:
1. Academy
2. Temple
3. Adventurer's Guild
4. Bank
5. Cottage
6. Estate
7. Lord's Manor

**Total renders needed:** 7 buildings × 4 angles = 28 PNG files

### TIPS:
- Start with ONE building to test full pipeline before batch rendering
- Use consistent lighting setup for all buildings
- Name files systematically: `buildingname_angle.png`
- Keep .blend file organized with collections per building
- Test in Godot after first building to validate sizing
