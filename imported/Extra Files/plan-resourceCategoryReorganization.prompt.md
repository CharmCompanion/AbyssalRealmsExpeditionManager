## Plan: Reorganize Starting Resources by Category with New Additions

Based on the design documents (city-builder mechanics from Pharaoh/Zeus, stats schema, and your MASTER_FEATURE_LIST), I need to reorganize the 7 current resources into logical categories and add new resources required for the game's city-builder systems. The resources should be organized by type (Basic Materials, Economic, Population/Infrastructure, Special/Services) and expanded to include Housing Capacity, Luxury Goods, Culture, Security, Favor, and Tools - covering the core mechanics from your design docs.

### Steps

1. **Add 6 new resources to CreateCharacter scene** - Insert Housing Capacity, Luxury Goods, Tools, Culture, Security, and Favor into `scenes/ui/CreateCharacter.tscn` ResourcesGrid, organizing all 13 resources into 4 category rows with clear labels and proper spacing

2. **Update CreateCharacter.gd resource logic** - Add new resource variables, default values, deity/kingdom modifiers, adjustment functions, seed calculation integration, and category-based relationships (e.g., Housing caps Population growth, Culture requires Gold, Security needs Iron) in `scripts/ui/CreateCharacter.gd`

3. **Verify/create Stats scene** - Locate existing stats display scene (possibly in `scenes/pages/` or `scenes/ui/`), update to show all 13 resources organized by category, or create new scene if missing from MainMenu navigation

4. **Update StatsMenu to match CreateCharacter** - Add missing resources (Iron, Mana) and all 6 new resources to the stats display in categorized layout matching CreateCharacter organization, ensure it's accessible from MainMenu.tscn proper navigation placement

5. **Adjust resource balance and relationships** - Set starting values for new resources (Housing: 75, Luxury: 20, Tools: 10, Culture: 10, Security: 15, Favor: 50), implement cross-resource effects (Luxury↔Gold, Housing caps Population, Culture costs Gold, Security needs Iron+Population), update deity/kingdom bonuses

### Further Considerations

1. **Resource categories vs flat list?** - Should resources display with category headers (Basic Materials / Economic / Population / Special) or remain flat with visual spacing? Category headers improve clarity but take more vertical space.

2. **GridContainer columns?** - Current 3-column grid works for 7 resources. With 13 resources, should we keep 3 columns (5 rows) or expand to 4 columns (4 rows) for better fit? Or organize by category with sub-grids?

3. **Stats scene location?** - If no dedicated stats scene exists, should it be added as a new page in the book UI (like GuildPage/MapPage/TownPage) or as a modal overlay from TopMenu? MainMenu navigation needs confirmation of proper placement.

## Research Summary: Required Resources from Design Documents

### Current Resources (7 total)
1. **Gold** - 4178 default, ±500 adjust
2. **Population** - 50 default, ±10 adjust
3. **Food** - 100 default, ±25 adjust
4. **Wood** - 50 default, ±15 adjust
5. **Stone** - 30 default, ±10 adjust
6. **Iron** - 15 default, ±5 adjust
7. **Mana** - 25 default, ±10 adjust

### Recommended New Resources (6 minimum)

#### Category: BASIC MATERIALS
- Wood ✅ (existing)
- Stone ✅ (existing)
- Iron ✅ (existing)
- Food ✅ (existing)

#### Category: ECONOMIC
- Gold ✅ (existing)
- **Luxury Goods** ⭐ NEW - Required for housing evolution (from Zeus: fleece/pottery/linens)
- **Tools** ⭐ NEW - Improves worker efficiency, crafted from iron/wood

#### Category: POPULATION & INFRASTRUCTURE
- Population ✅ (existing)
- **Housing Capacity** ⭐ NEW - Critical metric from schema (population vs housing availability)
- Worker Availability (calculated metric)

#### Category: SPECIAL / SERVICES
- Mana ✅ (existing)
- **Culture** ⭐ NEW - From schema: affects housing desirability, generated by culture buildings
- **Security** ⭐ NEW - From MASTER_FEATURE_LIST: affects crime/events, generated by barracks
- **Favor** ⭐ NEW - From schema: "Trade → Favor Levels", affects diplomacy and trade

### Proposed Organization: 13 Resources in 4 Categories

```
📦 BASIC MATERIALS (4 resources)
   - Food: [100] [-] [+]
   - Wood: [50]  [-] [+]
   - Stone: [30] [-] [+]
   - Iron: [15]  [-] [+]

💰 ECONOMIC (3 resources)
   - Gold: [4178] [-] [+]
   - Luxury: [20]  [-] [+] ⭐ NEW
   - Tools: [10]   [-] [+] ⭐ NEW

👥 POPULATION (3 resources)
   - People: [50]    [-] [+]
   - Housing: [75]   [-] [+] ⭐ NEW
   - Culture: [10]   [-] [+] ⭐ NEW

✨ SPECIAL (3 resources)
   - Mana: [25]     [-] [+]
   - Security: [15] [-] [+] ⭐ NEW
   - Favor: [50]    [-] [+] ⭐ NEW
```

### Key Mechanics from Design Documents

**From FantasyCityBuilder_StatsSchema.csv:**
- Population: Total citizens, worker availability, employed/unemployed tracking
- Housing: Evolution levels based on goods/services, desirability scores
- Goods: Resource stocks, food supply variety, distribution coverage
- Services: Coverage for fire, health, culture, religion
- Economy: Treasury, income, expenses, trade balance, tax impact
- Trade: World map, trade partners, route status, favor levels
- Military: Unit count, morale, resource readiness

**From Mechanics chat.txt (Pharaoh/Zeus Analysis):**
- Housing evolves based on: food variety + consumer goods + services + desirability
- Workforce: Houses supply workers; industries need proximity to housing
- Supply chain: Raw resources → Production → Storage → Distribution → Consumption
- Goods requirements: Common housing needs food, basic goods; elite needs luxury goods
- Culture/entertainment: Affects housing evolution and morale
- God favor/reputation: Affects blessings, curses, trade, diplomacy

### Resource Relationships & Balance

**Existing Relationships (from current code):**
- Gold ↑ → Population ↓ (emigration/taxation)
- Population ↑ → Food ↓, Wood ↓ (consumption)
- Food ↑ → Population ↑ (growth)
- Wood ↔ Stone (labor competition)
- Iron ↔ Stone (mining competition)
- Mana ↔ Iron (magic vs material focus)

**New Relationships to Implement:**
- **Housing Capacity caps Population growth** (cannot exceed housing)
- **Luxury Goods ↔ Gold** (trade-off between wealth and goods)
- **Culture requires Gold** to maintain (upkeep cost)
- **Security needs Iron + Population** (guards, equipment)
- **Favor affected by Luxury Goods** (diplomatic gifts)
- **Tools boost production** (efficiency multiplier)

### Starting Values & Adjust Steps

| Resource | Default | Adjust Step | Min | Max | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----|-----|-------|
| Food | 100 | ±25 | 25 | 300 | Basic survival |
| Wood | 50 | ±15 | 10 | 150 | Construction |
| Stone | 30 | ±10 | 5 | 100 | Buildings |
| Iron | 15 | ±5 | 0 | 50 | Advanced materials |
| Gold | 4178 | ±500 | 500 | 10000 | Currency |
| Luxury | 20 | ±5 | 0 | 100 | ⭐ NEW: Trade goods |
| Tools | 10 | ±5 | 0 | 50 | ⭐ NEW: Equipment |
| Population | 50 | ±10 | 15 | 150 | Citizens |
| Housing | 75 | ±10 | 30 | 200 | ⭐ NEW: Capacity |
| Culture | 10 | ±5 | 0 | 100 | ⭐ NEW: Entertainment |
| Mana | 25 | ±10 | 0 | 100 | Magic |
| Security | 15 | ±5 | 0 | 100 | ⭐ NEW: Military |
| Favor | 50 | ±10 | 0 | 100 | ⭐ NEW: Reputation |

### Deity/Kingdom Modifier Examples

**Deity Modifiers (sample):**
- War God: +Security, +Iron, -Culture
- Nature Deity: +Food, +Wood, -Stone
- Knowledge Deity: +Culture, +Mana, -Gold
- Trade Deity: +Gold, +Luxury, +Favor

**Kingdom Modifiers (sample):**
- Mountain Kingdom: +Stone, +Iron, +Housing (caves)
- Forest Kingdom: +Wood, +Food, +Culture
- Desert Kingdom: +Gold, +Favor (trade routes), -Food
- Coastal Kingdom: +Luxury (trade), +Food (fishing), +Favor

### Stats Scene Integration

**Existing Stats Display (from TownPage or similar):**
Currently shows:
- Population
- Gold
- Food Stores
- Wood
- Stone
- (Missing: Iron, Mana, and all 6 new resources)

**Required Updates:**
1. Add missing current resources (Iron, Mana)
2. Add all 6 new resources
3. Organize by category with headers
4. Match CreateCharacter layout for consistency
5. Consider tabs/sections if space limited

**Navigation Context:**
- Stats should be accessible from MainMenu or TopMenu
- Should match book page aesthetic (left page stats, right page details?)
- May need to create dedicated StatsPage.tscn if doesn't exist
