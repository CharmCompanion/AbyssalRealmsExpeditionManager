CityCrafter3D 1.0.1 3D Tools 4.4 Community
Submitted by user GEG-Fairbear8974; MIT; 2025-08-03

This is a city generator that builds 3D cities using a slot-based grid system. Each block can be different sizes (1x1, 2x1, 2x2), and blocks are assigned district types (residential, commercial, industrial) using noise or random placement.

- Buildings are placed based on the district and density settings, and can be reused by saving the CityConfiguration resource.
- Visuals and materials are pulled from your assigned assets in the configuration.
- Support for further subdivision and smaller subroads in residential zones.
- All generated components are standalone nodes within the world, allowing for post-generation adjustments.

UPDATE 1.0.1 = Updated .gitattribute file to play nice with the Asset Library, and added some additional examples in the main scene.
