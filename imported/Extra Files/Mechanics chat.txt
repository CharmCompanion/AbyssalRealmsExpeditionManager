Good call doing research — the classic city-builders Pharaoh (Ancient Egypt) and Zeus: Master of Olympus (Ancient Greece) are excellent reference points. Here’s a breakdown of their core mechanics (especially buildings, tracked stats, and visible feedback) and what you should pull into your own city-builder design.

### Buildings & chains

* Residential plots: You zone or place housing blocks; immigrants fill houses adjacent to roads, and the houses evolve when certain demands are met (goods + services) . ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][1])
* Service buildings: e.g., firehouses, police, courts – they hire “walkers” (agents that walk roads) to deliver services to houses. If houses lack service, they may stagnate or degrade. ([The Scientific Gamer][2])
* Goods supply chain: You have farms and resource buildings producing raw materials; granaries/warehouses store goods; bazaars or distribution nodes push goods into housing districts. One Reddit user explains:

  > “The bazars’ success depends on the distribution layout you were able to plan… The chain is fast and lean…” ([Reddit][3])
* Monument construction: Especially in Pharaoh, big constructions like mastabas or pyramids take whole supply chains (stone, wood, labor) and many steps. ([The Scientific Gamer][2])
* Walker mechanics: This “walker” or “carrier” model is central — service walkers roam neighborhoods; destination walkers move goods from warehouses to markets etc. ([Reddit][4])

### Tracked stats and evolution thresholds

* House evolution depends on: access to food + variety of consumer goods + services + desirability/surroundings. ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][1])
* Workforce: Houses supply labor/workers; if your industries are too far or there's no workforce, production drops. ([Reddit][3])
* Storage levels: Warehouses/granaries show how many units of e.g., food, pottery, beer are stocked — you can set target levels for trade. ([The Scientific Gamer][2])
* God / religion system: In Pharaoh you build temples/shrines for gods (Ra, Osiris, etc). If gods are pleased you get bonuses (e.g., flood blessings, better crop yield); if displeased you may get disasters. ([Wikipedia][5])
* City score / mission objectives: Goals might include population size, treasury size, monument completion, god favour. ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][1])

### Visual / UX feedback (good user cues)

* Buildings change appearance as they evolve (houses go from huts → more elaborate). ([The Scientific Gamer][2])
* Storage yards show icons of goods so you can visually inspect stock levels. ([The Scientific Gamer][2])
* When service walkers pass houses, you see “coverage” in effect — helps the player see which districts are serviced and which are starving for goods/services.
* Alerts or advisor messages indicate unmet demands (e.g., food shortage, unemployment, god displeasure).

### What changed / what to focus on

* Housing is divided from the start into **Common** (worker class) and **Elite** households, each with different requirements and roles. ([Codex Gamicus][6])
* Labor pool: Unlike earlier titles, buildings in Zeus don’t spawn citizens that walk to find jobs; instead, any placed building pulls from a global labour pool. This simplifies worker-matching and lets you place industry farther from housing without penalizing workforce. ([Codex Gamicus][6])
* Goods requirements simplified: Common housing in Zeus needs fewer commodity types (food [any type], fleece, olive oil) to evolve. Food types are pooled. ([Codex Gamicus][6])
* Culture/entertainment: Colleges, drama schools, gymnasiums feed into theatres/podiums/stadiums; these raise “culture” levels and help in events like the Pan-Hellenic Games. ([Codex Gamicus][6])
* Mythology & gods: Players construct Sanctuaries for gods; gods can bless your city (resources, protection) or curse you (monsters, disasters) depending on favour. ([TV Tropes][7])
* Trade & politics: Trade posts/ports with storage, diplomacy between cities (ally/enemy/vassal) affect trade, tribute, military. ([Codex Gamicus][6])
* Military tied into housing: Common houses supply basic units (“rabble”), elite houses supply better units (hoplites, cavalry) if supplied with armor, horses. This ties civilian structure into defence/offence. ([Codex Gamicus][6])

### Tracked stats / mechanics

* Housing desirability/need satisfaction: Distance to services, access to goods, culture, and attractiveness matter for elite housing. ([Codex Gamicus][6])
* Resource inputs: Trees/wood, marble, bronze, grapes/olive/fleece etc. Industry transforms raw -> refined. ([Codex Gamicus][6])
* Trade inventory: Trade buildings hold export/import stock and manage what you send/receive. ([Codex Gamicus][6])
* God favour/curse state: Depending on which gods you support or anger, you monitor blessings/curses.
* Military readiness: Number of units active, resource provisioning (armor/horses), readiness of ships/towers.
* Diplomacy/favour per city: Each other city has a favour value to you; this influences trade and war. ([Codex Gamicus][6])

### Visual / UX feedback

* Distinct visuals for common vs elite housing sizes and look.
* Goods distribution via Agora/peddlers visible walking roads so you can observe whether goods are reaching neighborhoods.
* Sanctuaries: gods occasionally appear in your city to bless/do miracles — this is strong visual feedback for your state of favour.
* Alerts about gods angered, monsters unleashed, or trade disruptions.

## What to take into *your* city-builder design

Since you’re building your own system (for example your spaced-out Tycoon system or city-builder mode), here are recommendations drawn from the above — raw truths, no sugar-coating:

### Mechanics you should definitely include

1. **Residential evolution**: Have houses evolve as you satisfy layers of need (goods, services, surroundings). This gives players goals with visible progression.
2. **Goods & supply chains**: Raw resources → production buildings → storage → distribution → consumption. Even if you abstract it somewhat, players like seeing the chain.
3. **Services & coverage**: Houses need services (health, fire, culture) and proximity / distribution matters. Use agents or radius/coverage to simulate it.
4. **Distinct building types with roles**: E.g., workers vs elite homes; service buildings; industrial buildings; trade buildings; monuments/special expansions.
5. **Feedback & metrics**: Provide clear metrics (unemployment, goods shortage, desirability, population growth, resource stock levels). Without that players feel blind.
6. **Visible flows**: If possible show goods flowing, agents walking, changes in building visuals. It reinforces the player’s connection to what’s going on.
7. **Progressive complexity**: Early game simpler (just food + housing), later game unlocks more goods, trade, monuments, special mechanics like gods/monsters/events.
8. **Goals/objectives**: Missions or sandbox with objectives: population target, treasury, monument built, trade balance, god favour. Keeps things interesting.
9. **Conflict/pressure**: Could be disasters, invasion, resource scarcity, political favour. Provides tension and reason to optimize.

### What stats you should track & show to players

* **Population**: total, by class (worker/elite), growth rate.
* **Housing occupancy & quality**: number of homes, evolved levels, vacancies.
* **Workforce & employment**: number of available workers, unemployed, industrial capacity.
* **Resource stock levels**: raw resources (wood, stone, etc), manufactured goods, goods for consumption (food, luxury goods).
* **Goods supply/demand deficits**: what goods are missing in neighborhoods, how that impacts housing evolution.
* **Services coverage**: percent of houses within range of fire brigade, healthcare, culture, religion etc.
* **Desirability/surroundings**: maybe a rating per housing block (noise, pollution, prestige).
* **Treasury / economy**: income (tax, trade), expenses (services, army, maintenance), balance.
* **Trade & diplomacy**: exports/imports, trade partners, favour levels, import dependency.
* **Military/defense**: units available, strength, readiness, threats.
* **Special mechanics**: e.g., in your design if you include gods or monuments: favour score, construction progress, bonuses, penalties.

### UI/Design suggestions

* Use building pop-up panels: On click a building shows its current stats (workers assigned, good status, service radius, production rate).
* Overlays: heatmaps for service coverage, goods shortage, desirability.
* Visual cues: evolved houses change visually; goods icons on storage/warehouses; service walkers or peddlers move along roads; god effect animations.
* Alerts/notifications: tell the player “houses are downgrading due to lack of food”, “god is angered”, “storage yard filling”, “trade partner cut off imports”.
* Modular complexity: maybe hint to players what building provides what before unlocking all mechanics.

---

## Special Notes / Considerations

* The walker/agent model (Pharaoh) is elegant but can get complex to implement and optimize (path-finding, traffic). If you’re building a city maker, you might abstract it (e.g., supply radius instead of visible walkers) unless you want that “see the people moving” feel.
* The division of housing classes (worker vs elite) in Zeus is a good way to add depth and differentiation — consider if your system benefits from distinct population tiers.
* Monuments / big build projects give the player long-term goals beyond just “grow bigger”. If your game has a tycoon or progression model, include at least one long-term mega-project.
* Feedback loops are crucial. If players build something and see no difference (no visible evolution, no stat change), they’ll feel disconnected.
* Balancing visibility vs micromanagement: The classic games are fairly micromanagement heavy (you set warehouse targets, route layout, etc). Decide how much complexity you want for your target audience.
* Consider modern UX: Although these classics are older, their clarity is strong. But you can improve with modern UI (tooltips, graphs, dashboards) so players aren’t left digging.

If you like, I can **extract a detailed table** of *every* building type from both games (housing, service, industrial, god/temple, trade/military) with **what stats they provide** and **what triggers they track** (e.g., “House evolves when X food types + Y services + desirability ≥ Z”). That might give you a full blueprint for your design. Want me to pull that together?

Heck yes, Dima — here’s a no-fluff, comprehensive breakdown of **what the UI exposes, what stats are tracked, what buildings do, and how events/trading work** in the two touchstones: **Pharaoh** and **Zeus: Master of Olympus.** I’ll separate them so you can lift pieces straight into your design.

---

# Pharaoh (1999 / A New Era)

## Core city stats surfaced in the UI

* **Population & workforce:** total pop, immigration/emigration, **age histogram** and active worker band (20–50 years) in the Population/Workers overseer; worker shortages/unemployment are tracked explicitly. ([Steam Community][1])
* **Commerce & trade:** overseer toggles to **open/close routes**, **import/export** per-good, target stock amounts, and price view; trade works via **Storage Yards** (land) and **Docks** (sea). ([sierrahelp.com][2])
* **Goods & storage:** per-building stock readouts; **Granary** (food-only, capacity details), **Storage Yard** (any goods, slotting). ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][3])
* **Housing evolution & desirability:** houses show unmet needs (food types, pottery/beer/linens/papyrus, services), plus area desirability. (General mechanics summary from series guides.) ([Reddit][4])

## Buildings → mechanics (what they provide)

* **Granary**: accepts locally produced food; **3,200 units** capacity; holds up to **four food types**; bazaars pull from here; imported food goes to Storage Yards. ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][3])
* **Storage Yard**: 8 slots; each slot stores **4 units (or 400, by type)**; accepts any non-food goods, imported food, and serves traders; must be staffed to accept. ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][5])
* **Bazaar**: two **buyers** (food + goods) fetch from nearby granary/yards; **traders** (peddlers) then **walk** housing roads and deliver, driving housing evolution. ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][6])
* **Docks**: enable sea trade; must be road-connected to storage; (A New Era) you can whitelist goods per dock. ([GOG.com][7])
* **Industry**: farms/mines → workshops; staffed from housing labor pool; outputs stock tracked at yards/granaries; affects trade/export ability. (Series guide.) ([Reddit][4])

## Trading model (land vs sea)

* **Land trade:** pay to open route; ensure **Storage Yard** accepts the good; set **Overseer of Commerce** to buy/sell and desired levels; traders come by road to the yard. ([GOG.com][7])
* **Sea trade:** pay to open route; build **Dock**; connect Dock to yards; in A New Era, set dock’s allowed goods; use overseer to set import/export thresholds. ([GOG.com][7])
* **Best-practice UI settings:** use numeric **“export when over X / import to maintain X”** rather than generic surplus toggles (A New Era reliability). ([Steam Community][8])

## Event systems (pressures on the city)

* **Requests & demands** from the Kingdom (timed shipments) — fulfilled via stocked goods (trade/storage toggles). (Series guides and community references.) ([Reddit][4])
* **Disasters & hazards** (fire, collapse), **disease**, **crime** — mitigated by service buildings with walkers (firehouse, architects, physicians, police/courts). (Series guides.) ([Reddit][4])
* **Monument projects** (mastabas, pyramids) — multi-good, multi-stage supply sinks that force surplus planning. ([Steam Community][9])

# Zeus: Master of Olympus (2000)

## Control Panel tabs & what the UI shows

* **Population tab:** place **Common** vs **Elite** housing; Zeus formalizes class split at the UI level. 
* **Distribution tab:** storage and flow controls; **See Distribution** overlay shows **icons above each house** for items it can store, flashing red when a good is missing/expiring — superb visibility you should emulate. 
* **Administration:** **Taxes & income** (tax rate effects, popularity/appeal links), **exports** visibility via World map; notes on tribute/gifts. 
* **Aesthetics:** parks/beautification and **Commemorative Monuments** granted for **Population** and **Happiness** milestones — clear feedback loop between stats and landmark unlocks. 
* **World / diplomacy panel:** per-city **diplomatic state**, **favor/attitude**, **buy/sell quotas** and history, **economic strength (coin stacks)**, **military strength (shields)**; distant cities trade only. ([Archive.org][10])
* **City update / events list:** condensed city report; **up to eight outstanding requests/demands** with timers, quantities, and “overdue” markers; green light when you can fulfill. This is your gold standard for surfacing pressures. 

## Buildings → mechanics (what they provide)

* **Common Agora:** vendors (food/goods) + peddlers distribute into neighborhoods; Distribution tab governs **stockpiling**, **too distant**, **no labor** states. 
* **Granary / Warehouse equivalents:** granary for food; storage for goods; both tie into Distribution/See Distribution overlays. 
* **Culture chain:** **Colleges, Drama Schools, Gymnasia** → feed **Theatres, Podia, Stadiums**; raise culture requirements for elite housing. (Manual sections list under Culture.) ([Archive.org][10])
* **Religion/Myth:** **Sanctuaries** for gods; grant blessings/units/bonuses; gods and monsters can physically visit/attack. (Quick reference + manual.) ([cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com][11])
* **Military:** **Rabble** from common, **Hoplites/Cavalry** from elite (when resourced with armor, horses); unit cards show **morale** and orders in the Control Panel. ([Codex Gamicus][12])

## Trading model

* **Trading Posts/Ports** are city interfaces; **World panel** shows per-partner **buy/sell caps** and annual sold/bought totals; you issue **trade orders** per city from that screen. ([Archive.org][10])
* **Export scaling:** manual recommends checking near year-end whether you **sold less than partner demand** → expand production to hit cap. 

## Event systems

* **Requests & Demands:** allies ask; rivals **demand** (timed, color-coded); fulfill by shipping goods or forces; UI shows timers, quantities, and relationships. 
* **Mythic events:** gods request **Quests**; failure invites curses or monsters; sanctuaries alter frequency/strength of interventions. (Manual Mythology section.) ([Archive.org][10])
* **Diplomacy shifts:** favor per city affects **trade access**, **tribute**, **military**, visible in World panel with explicit iconography (coins/shields/banners). 

---

## Side-by-side: the stats you’ll want to track & *show* (UI-visible) in your builder

**Population & labor**

* Total pop; **classes** (common/elite or tiers), **vacancy/occupancy**, **age/worker band** (20–50 style), immigration/emigration, **unemployment** and **worker shortage**. (Pharaoh’s overseer; Zeus population tab). ([Steam Community][1])

**Housing state**

* House **level**, **next-needs list**, last service/goods received timestamp, **desirability/appeal** indicator (road quality gag from Zeus is a neat minimalist cue). 

**Goods & distribution**

* Citywide stock totals by good; per-neighborhood **delivery coverage** (overlay like “See Distribution” with **icons above houses**; red flash when near empty). 

**Services**

* Coverage heatmaps for **water, hygiene/health, fire, crime/police, maintenance, culture, religion**; show **% homes covered** and bottlenecks.

**Economy**

* Treasury; **income (tax, exports, tribute/gifts)** and **expenses** (wages, maintenance, military); **tax rate** and **popularity** linkage. 

**Trade & diplomacy**

* Per partner: **buy/sell caps**, **sold this year**, **price**, **favor**, route status; world map **strength/economy** icons; request/demand queue with timers. ([Archive.org][10])

**Military**

* Unit **count**, **morale**, **equipment readiness**; garrison levels; invasion warnings. ([Archive.org][10])

**Milestones/Events**

* **Requests/demands** list (up to N visible, with overdue markers); **monument progress**; **happiness/population** milestones granting commemoratives/bonuses. 

---

## Design takeaways (what to steal shamelessly)

1. **House-top need icons (Zeus)** — a one-glance diagnosis tool; flash when a good is out. Build this. 
2. **Dual-class housing (Zeus)** — clean split of early vs late game complexity; elite consumed goods unlock military/culture. 
3. **Overseer/Advisor dashboards (Pharaoh)** — explicit **trade amounts**, **price view**, **import/export thresholds**; pair with per-route caps. ([sierrahelp.com][2])
4. **World panel as a living ledger (Zeus)** — show partner **attitude**, **economy**, **military**, and **annual trade totals** in one place. ([Archive.org][10])
5. **Storage rules matter** — Pharaoh’s **Granary vs Storage Yard** asymmetry (food vs goods/imports) adds interesting logistics; consider a similar constraint to make road/placement matter. ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][3])

---

## Quick reference: high-signal building stats (selected)

**Pharaoh**

* **Granary:** 3,200 food units; up to 4 food types; Bazaar gets **local** food here; **imported** food goes to **Storage Yards**. ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][3])
* **Storage Yard:** 8 slots × 4/400 units (type-dependent); accepts goods & imported food; traders interface here; must be staffed. ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][5])
* **Bazaar:** 2 buyers (food/goods) + walking traders; primary driver of housing evolution. ([impressionsgames.fandom.com][6])

**Zeus**

* **Distribution system:** “See Distribution” overlay, vendor/peddler states (**Too Distant / Stockpiled / Distributing / No Labor**). 
* **Aesthetics/Appeal:** parks/ponds/benches; **Commemorative Monuments** unlocked by **Population/Happiness** milestones. 
* **Admin/Taxes:** tax rate ↔ popularity/appeal; exports tracked via world map; mints monetize silver ore.

If you want this turned into a **CSV or JSON schema** you can feed straight into your game (entities, stats, UI fields, thresholds), say the word and I’ll spit out a ready-to-wire blueprint.
