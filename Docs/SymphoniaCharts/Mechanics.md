## Befriending Monsters
1. Reduce the monster's HP to a low value (ideally in the red zone).
2. Use a Pact Ring during battle to attempt to befriend the monster.
3. The chance of success increases with lower HP and certain items or skills.
4. Some monsters require special conditions (e.g., specific elemental attacks) to be befriended.
5. If successful, the monster joins your party after battle.

## Obtaining Items
1. Items can be found in chests, dropped by enemies, purchased in shops, or received as quest rewards.
2. Some rare items only drop from specific monsters or bosses.
3. Stealing from enemies may yield unique items not found elsewhere.
4. Synthesize new items by combining materials at shops or with special skills.

## Pact Star Rules
1. Each monster family has a Pact Star requirement for befriending.
2. The number of Pact Stars increases as you befriend more monsters of the same family.
3. Some rare monsters require a full set of Pact Stars before they can be befriended.
4. Losing a monster may reduce your Pact Star count for that family.

## Evolution System
1. Monsters evolve when they reach a certain level and meet specific conditions.
2. Some evolutions require special items or elemental affinities.
3. Evolved monsters gain new skills, higher stats, and may change appearance.
4. Not all monsters can evolve; check the evolution chart for details.

## Battle and Encounter Rules
1. Encounters are triggered by touching visible enemies on the field or through random events in certain areas.
2. Each area has a unique set of possible enemy groups.
3. Some encounters are scripted and may include bosses or rare monsters.
4. Fleeing from battle may have consequences, such as lost items or reduced rewards.

## Synthesis System
1. Collect synthesis materials from enemy drops, chests, or shops.
2. Visit a synthesis shop or use a synthesis skill in the menu.
3. Select the item you wish to synthesize and ensure you have the required materials.
4. Pay the synthesis fee (if any) and confirm the synthesis.
5. The new item will be added to your inventory.

## Status Effects
1. Status effects can be inflicted by enemy attacks, traps, or items.
2. Common effects include Poison, Paralysis, Sleep, and Confusion.
3. Use Panacea Bottles or specific skills to cure status effects.
4. Some accessories grant immunity to certain status effects.

## Monster Skills and Artes
