Here is a comprehensive summary of all key information and progress from our previous work, so you can continue seamlessly in a new prompt:

Project Goal:
Convert the "Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World" guide into structured markdown charts for monsters, items, encounters, evolutions, and step-by-step mechanics lists. Each chart is grouped logically (by family/type/area), omits redundant columns, and is designed for clarity and reference.

What Has Been Created So Far:

A directory: SymphoniaCharts
Documentation files:
README.md (explains chart structure and purpose)
Mechanics.md (step-by-step mechanics lists, expanded in batches)
Monster Family Charts:
PlantFamily.md
BeastFamily.md
BirdFamily.md
Item Type Charts:
Gels.md
Bottles.md
Accessories.md
Encounter Area Charts:
LakeSinoaCave_Encounters.md
TrietRuins_Encounters.md
BalacrufMausoleum_Encounters.md
Evolution Family Charts:
PlantFamily_Evolutions.md
BeastFamily_Evolutions.md
BirdFamily_Evolutions.md
Mechanics Document (Mechanics.md) includes:
Befriending monsters
Obtaining items
Pact star rules
Evolution system
Battle and encounter rules
Synthesis system
Status effects
Monster skills and artes
Format and Approach:

Each chart is a markdown table, grouped by logical category (family/type/area).
Redundant columns are omitted if all entries share the same value.
Mechanics are written as clear, step-by-step lists.
The process is ongoing, with more families, types, areas, and mechanics to be added in further batches.
User Requirements:

The full set of data, not just samples.
No redundant columns in charts.
Continue in logical batches until the entire guide is converted.
Provide clear, actionable summaries for handoff or continuation.
Current Status:

Multiple batches of charts and mechanics have been created and saved in the SymphoniaCharts directory.
The process is designed to continue until all monster families, item types, encounter areas, and evolution families are fully converted, and all relevant mechanics are documented.
How to Continue:

Keep adding new markdown files for each remaining monster family, item type, encounter area, and evolution family.
Expand Mechanics.md with any additional systems or rules from the guide.
Follow the established format for clarity and consistency.
You can use this summary as a handoff or to continue the work in a new prompt. If you need the actual markdown content of any specific file, let me know which one(s) and I can provide the full text.
