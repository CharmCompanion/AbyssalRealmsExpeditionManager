Yep — you’re clear.

Here’s a **Copilot “Agent prompt”** you can paste into VS Code (Chat/Copilot Edits) so it can fix your project *without redesigning your UI content* and while using `UIFrame.tscn` exactly like MainMenu.

---

## Copilot Prompt (paste this as-is)

You are working inside a Godot 4.5 project. DO NOT redesign UI layouts or replace content. DO NOT invent new UI. The goal is to restore/repair scenes so they match MainMenu’s panel framing system and keep all existing inner content working and sized correctly.

### Objective

Make these scenes use the shared frame in `res://scenes/ui/shared/UIFrame.tscn`:

* `res://scenes/ui/SaveSelect.tscn`
* `res://scenes/ui/CreateTown.tscn` (CreateCharacter has been renamed to CreateTown; CreateCharacter name must remain available for later use)
* `res://scenes/ui/Settings.tscn`

MainMenu is already correct. Use it as the reference for sizing and wrapper structure.

### Requirements (must follow exactly)

1. Each scene must show the BACKGROUND around the panel (panel must NOT fill the whole screen).
2. Every scene’s panel frame must be the SAME SIZE as MainMenu’s panel frame.
3. The frame must include:

   * Dim background overlay
   * Panel background
   * Drop shadow
   * Gold outline/border
4. KEEP ALL EXISTING CONTENT/NODES inside each scene exactly as they are (buttons, lists, containers, signals, scripts).

   * No renaming of existing content nodes.
   * No deletion of content nodes.
   * No moving content nodes around except to place them under the proper frame container.
5. Fix “Parent path has vanished when instantiating” warnings by restoring the expected node parent chain.
6. Fix “This node doesn’t have a control parent” problems by ensuring scene roots and wrappers are Controls.
7. Use backups for recovery if needed:

   * There is a `backups/` folder containing prior versions of scenes and scripts. Use it to restore content trees if something is missing.
8. CreateTown rename:

   * Update references from CreateCharacter -> CreateTown ONLY where it refers to the town creation scene (scene path, script path, button scene change).
   * Do NOT delete or repurpose CreateCharacter for later work.
9. Do not touch `MainMenu.tscn` except to ensure its scene-change paths point to the renamed `CreateTown.tscn` if needed.

### Implementation details (match MainMenu structure)

In each target scene, ensure this high-level structure exists (exact names if MainMenu uses them):

* Root: `Control` (named same as scene root, e.g., SaveSelect)
* `Dim` (ColorRect) full-rect overlay
* `PanelWrap` (Control) anchored/centered like MainMenu so the panel does NOT fill the screen
* Inside PanelWrap: instantiate `UIFrame.tscn` OR duplicate the same node structure used by MainMenu that came from UIFrame
* Place the scene’s existing content inside the UIFrame’s content container (whatever MainMenu uses, e.g., `Panel/Margin/PageContainer` or similar)

### Tasks

A) Inspect MainMenu.tscn to identify:

* exact node names for Dim, PanelWrap, and UIFrame instance
* exact container node where content should be parented
* panel size / anchors / offsets used
  B) For each of SaveSelect, CreateTown, Settings:
* Restore the same frame/wrapper structure as MainMenu
* Reparent the existing content tree under the correct container node in the UIFrame without changing that content’s internal hierarchy
* Ensure anchors for PanelWrap / UIFrame match MainMenu so all frames are identical size
* Preserve signals and script attachments
  C) Fix broken parent paths:
* If a scene has nodes referencing missing parents (warnings), repair by reparenting nodes or restoring missing wrapper nodes from backups.
  D) Output:
* Provide the final updated `.tscn` files and any modified `.gd` script changes as a patch/diff or direct file edits.
* Summarize exactly what was changed per file.

### Guardrails

* Do not change fonts, theme colors, button sizes, or inner layout of the content.
* Only adjust the OUTER frame/wrapper and the parenting location so the content sits inside the shared frame.
* If any content nodes are missing, recover them from backups and reinsert them under the same names.
* If any scripts reference old node paths, update the script paths carefully to match the restored structure, but keep content node names.

Start now by analyzing `res://scenes/ui/MainMenu.tscn` and `res://scenes/ui/shared/UIFrame.tscn`, then apply the same structure to SaveSelect, CreateTown, and Settings.

## One extra line you should add (makes Copilot behave)

At the top of the Copilot chat, add:

**“Do not generate new UI. Only fix frame parenting and sizing to match MainMenu exactly.”**

---

## Quick sanity checklist (so you know it did the right thing)

After Copilot finishes, you should see:

* No more “Parent path … has vanished” spam
* In every scene:

  * background visible around the panel
  * same panel size as MainMenu
  * same drop shadow + gold outline
  * content looks identical (just correctly placed)

If you want, paste your MainMenu scene tree (just the node hierarchy) and I’ll tailor the prompt to your *exact* container node names so Copilot has less room to drift.
